# Attractions Manager

This is my first React project as part of my college assignments in my full stack development class. It fetches Dublin attractions from a json file and displays them on a table to be viewed and managed.

What it can do:
- **See attractions**: Shows a list of attractions from a JSON file.
- **Add new attractions**: You can add attractions with all details, including multiple images.
- **Edit or delete attractions**: Change or remove existing entries, with a "Confirm Delete" modal for safety.
- **Search, sort, and filter**: Easily find attractions and sort them, filter by rating, tags, or whether they’re free.
- **Automatic "free" property**: Attractions are marked as free if their description includes the word "free."
- **Tags manager**: Manage tags for attractions — add, edit, or delete them, and changes update across all attractions.
- **CRUD**: creating, reading, updating, and deleting items in React.
